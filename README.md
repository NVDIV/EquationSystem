# Linear Equation System Solver

This C program solves a system of linear equations using an iterative method. It accepts the coefficients of the equations and the corresponding right-hand side values from the user, ensuring the system is well-posed before performing the calculations.

## Features

- Input the number of equations and coefficients.
- Check for convergence to ensure the iterative method will work.
- Output the solution to the system of equations.
- User-friendly interface with input validation.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language

## Getting Started

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the ropository:
  ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/NVDIV/EquationSystem.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd EquationSystem
```
3. Compile the program:
  ```bash
  gcc -o eqsystem eqsystem.c
```
4. Run the program:
```bash
./eqsystem
```

## How to Use

Enter the number of equations in the system.
For each equation, input the coefficients and the right-hand side value.
The program will check for convergence and solve the system of equations if it is well-posed.
The solution will be displayed in the console.
